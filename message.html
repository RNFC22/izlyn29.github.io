            Happy Birthday My Beautiful Wife!<br>
            <br>
            I want to start off by saying, Im sorry… because I wasn’t there for your celebration this week due to school reasons, but the moment I am back, I will definitely make it up to you!<br>
            <br>
            I hope that even though I wasn’t around, you were still able to enjoy the rest of the day with your friends and mine, looking at your stories and how you were, despite you being sad, I could tell that you really had a great time, till you couldn’t even sleep! AND I WAS WAITING FOR YOU HMPH HMPH HAAHAHHAAH but it is okay, I am in no position to say such things!<br>
            <br>
            I hope by now, you realise just how blessed you are, you have more than 5 people who are willing to do all those things for you and to make sure that you have a successful celebration! Be blessed and be grateful like I told you a few days back my love because truly you are more blessed than myself HEHE<br>
            <br>
            To people’s eyes, you have grown older, but to my eyes, your 23 true but to me your 3 HAHAHA and that will never change, you will always be a baby to me no matter how old you get, and the only time you turn into an adult is when your mad at me! So I want you to enjoy your day today, I want you to reflect just how far you’ve gotten in your life! Be thankful for the life you have right now bubba, because I definitely am thanks to you! <br>
            <br>
            I will be back there very very soon sayang, let’s continue to pray that no matter what things will go as planned and since we weren’t able to see one another during our birthdays, I am sure that ahead of us will be a great blessing HEHE<br>
            <br>
            So once again my sayang, Happy Birthday to you! May Allah continue to bless you with great health and fortune along your way, Amin! <br>
            <br>
            I LOVE YOU SO VERY VERY FUCKING MUCH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE IZLYN FLORES!!!
            <br>
            Your Husband,<br>
